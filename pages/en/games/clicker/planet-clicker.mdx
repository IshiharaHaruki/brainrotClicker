4. Unlock Mars at 100K energy in Planet Clicker
5. Reach Venus at 1 trillion energy milestone

## Planet Clicker Planet Progression

### Earth - The Blue Marble

Your starting world in Planet Clicker:
- Lowest production but highest accessibility in Planet Clicker
- Most affordable upgrades for bootstrapping
- Perfect for click power investments
- Maintains relevance through percentage bonuses

**Optimal Earth Strategy:**
- Maximize click power first (0-10K phase) in Planet Clicker
- Build 3-5 farms before transitioning
- Keep upgrading for synergy bonuses
- Use Earth as baseline production in Planet Clicker

### Mars - The Red Frontier

Second planet with 10x multiplier in Planet Clicker:
- Unlocks around 100K energy in Planet Clicker
- More expensive upgrades but higher returns
- Mid-game focus for rapid acceleration
- Dramatically increases energy generation

**Optimal Mars Strategy:**
- Transition once Earth foundations solid

- Build power plants before farms
- Use Mars to fund Earth development

### Venus - The Ultimate Challenge

Final planet requiring 1 trillion energy in Planet Clicker:
- Supreme energy generation potential
- Extremely expensive multipliers
- Represents ultimate achievement in Planet Clicker
- Production eclipses Earth + Mars combined

**Venus Preparation:**
- Max Earth and Mars first in Planet Clicker
- Ensure 10M+ per second passive income

## Planet Clicker Infrastructure Guide

### Farms in Planet Clicker

Essential passive generators in Planet Clicker:
- **Basic Farm** (500 energy): 1 energy/second in Planet Clicker
- **Advanced Farm** (5K energy): 10 energy/second
- **Industrial Farm** (100K+): 100+ energy/second in Planet Clicker

**Farm Strategy:** Build multiple lower-tier farms before advancing. Five basic farms beat one advanced farm in cost efficiency for Planet Clicker early game.

### Power Plants in Planet Clicker

High-output generators with exponential returns:
- **Solar Power Plant** (2K energy): 5 energy/second in Planet Clicker
- **Nuclear Power Plant** (50K): 50 energy/second
- **Fusion Power Plant** (5M+): 500+ energy/second in Planet Clicker
- **Quantum Generator** (Endgame): Thousands per second

**Power Plant Strategy:** Rush first power plant in Planet Clicker, then balance with farms for consistent growth.

## Planet Clicker Advanced Strategies

### The Exponential Formula

Understanding growth in Planet Clicker:
Total Production = (Click Power × Click Rate) + (Passive Generators × Multipliers)

**Planet Clicker Progression:**
- Early game: Clicking dominates
- Mid game: Passive equalizes in Planet Clicker
- Late game: Passive dominates (99% production)

### Idle Optimization for Planet Clicker

Maximize offline gains in Planet Clicker:
- Spend all energy on passive generators before AFK
- Purchase highest-tier available structures
- Balance buildings across planets in Planet Clicker
- Never hold large energy reserves

**Overnight Strategy:** Well-optimized Planet Clicker setup generates 10-100x more energy overnight than active clicking.

### Planet Balancing in Planet Clicker

Managing multiple planets in Planet Clicker:
- **Early** (Earth only): 100% Earth investment
- **Post-Mars** (100K-1M): 30% Earth, 70% Mars in Planet Clicker
- **Pre-Venus** (100M-1T): 10% Earth, 40% Mars, 50% saving
- **Post-Venus** (1T+): 5% Earth, 15% Mars, 80% Venus in Planet Clicker

Avoid these errors when playing Planet Clicker:
- Over-clicking in late game phases
- Hoarding energy instead of investing in Planet Clicker
- Ignoring Earth after Mars unlock
- Building unbalanced infrastructure
- Rushing Venus without 50M+ per second income
